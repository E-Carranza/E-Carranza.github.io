# Ever Carranza's Portfolio

I am a Salvadoran guy majoring in computer science at CSUF. I am 18 years old and plan on graduating in 2028. I chose computer science because the degree offers job prospects and has a significant social impact. In the future, I would like to start my own business to advocate for my community. 


## Favorirte CPSC-120L Labs 

* Lab 6

    During my time in CSPC 120L, I have learned multiple things that have helped me academically and personally. In labs, I had the opportunity to make friends and establish communication with others. Some labs were complicated, but some were cool. Lab 6 was my favorite because it was easy. I had made part of the code before attending class that day. My teammates helped me to fix some logical errors when the class began. This action enabled us to finish the lab 35 minutes before class. I got lucky even though I did the first part. Gabriel, my teammate for that class, was prepared, and we figured out the stuff easily.


* Lab 10, Part-1

    I loved lab 10 because it consisted of a single part and Eduardo and I were writing a code that used a 2D vector. Also, we were writing function definitions. It was not an easy process but we figured out how to assign the California counties’ data, which was the main purpose of the lab. We didn’t have a really complicated problem, my teammate played an important role in coding. I like how the program  reported the percentage of the population of the state's counties.


* Lab 4, Part-2

    Definitely, one of the best labs was the number four in my opinion. It was called the guessing game. In part two, we wrote a code that had a winner number and the participants had to guess the number. Also, there was the introduction of the “double function”, something that helped us in the upcoming labs. My teammates and I completed the second part of the lab in class. We had some problems but at the end of the day, the test passed correctly.
